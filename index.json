Its light curves rise to maximum light in 5-6 d and then display a decline of ∆m15 ∼ 5 mag. With such a pronounced decay, it has one of the most rapidly evolving light curves known for a stellar explosion. The early spectra show similarities to normal and 'ultra-stripped' type Ic SNe, but the early nebular phase spectra, which were reached just over two weeks after explosion, display prominent calcium lines, marking SN 2019bkc as a Ca-rich transient. The Ca emission lines at this phase show an unprecedented and unexplained blueshift of 10 000-12 000 km s-1. Modelling of the light curve and the early spectra suggests that the transient had a low ejecta mass of 0.2-0.4 M☉ and a low kinetic energy of (2-4) × 1050 erg, giving a specific kinetic energy Ek/Mej ∼ 1 [1051 erg]/M☉. The origin of this event cannot be unambiguously defined. While the abundance distribution used to model the spectra marginally favours a progenitor of white dwarf origin through the tentative identification of Ar II, the specific kinetic energy, which is defined by the explosion mechanism, is found to be more similar to an ultra-stripped core-collapse events. SN 2019bkc adds to the diverse range of physical properties shown by Ca-rich events.

The bolometric luminosity evolves too quickly to be explained by pure 56Ni heating, necessitating the inclusion of an alternative powering source. Incorporating the spin-down of a magnetized neutron star adequately describes the lightcurve and we estimate a small ejecta mass of M ej = 0.10 ± 0.05 M ☉. Our spectral modeling suggests the ejecta is composed of intermediate mass elements including O, Si, and Mg and trace amounts of Fe-peak elements, which disfavors a binary neutron star merger. We discuss three explosion scenarios for SN2018kzr, given the low ejecta mass, intermediate mass element composition, and high likelihood of additional powering—the core collapse of an ultra-stripped progenitor, the accretion induced collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf, and the merger of a white dwarf and neutron star. The requirement for an alternative input energy source favors either the AIC with magnetar powering or a white dwarf-neutron star merger with energy from disk wind shocks.","tags":["Magnetars","Supernovae","White dwarf stars","High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"title":"SN2018kzr: A Rapidly Declining Transient from the Destruction of a White Dwarf","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Taubenberger","S.","Floers","A.","Vogl","C.","Kromer","M.","Spyromilio","J.","Aldering","G.","Antilogus","P.","Bailey","S.","Baltay","C.","Bongard","S.","Boone","K.","Buton","C.","Chotard","N.","Copin","Y.","Dixon","S.","Fouchez","D.","Fransson","C.","Gangler","E.","Gupta","R.

Here, we present and discuss the most comprehensive optical data set of this SN to date, comprised of a densely sampled series of early-time spectra obtained within the Nearby Supernova Factory project, plus photometry and spectroscopy obtained at the Very Large Telescope about 1 yr after the explosion. The light curves, colour curves, spectral time series, and ejecta velocities of SN 2012dn are compared with those of other 09dc-like and normal SNe Ia, the overall variety within the class of 09dc-like SNe Ia is discussed, and new criteria for 09dc-likeness are proposed. Particular attention is directed to additional insight that the late-phase data provide. The nebular spectra show forbidden lines of oxygen and calcium, elements that are usually not seen in late-time spectra of SNe Ia, while the ionization state of the emitting iron plasma is low, pointing to low ejecta temperatures and high densities. The optical light curves are characterized by an enhanced fading starting ∼60 d after maximum and very low luminosities in the nebular phase, which is most readily explained by unusually early formation of clumpy dust in the ejecta. Taken together, these effects suggest a strongly perturbed ejecta density profile, which might lend support to the idea that 09dc-like characteristics arise from a brief episode of interaction with a hydrogen-deficient envelope during the first hours or days after the explosion.

The most recent determinations have revealed a 4.4σ discrepancy between the local value of H0, based on the distance ladder approach with Cepheid stars and type Ia supernovae, and the determination from the cosmic microwave background. If this holds up, then ΛCDM is not the complete model of the Universe. A measurement of the local H0 which does not rely on the distance ladder represents a critical and independent check.\nThe method that is being applied here to get absolute distances is called the expanding-photosphere method. In principle, the method determines distances to type II-P SNe by comparing their photospheric angular size with the expansion velocity measured from spectral lines. However, since the photospheres of SNe II-P have low densities and are dominated by electron scattering, the photospheric flux is diluted relative to a Planck function at the best-fitting continuum colour temperature. Therefore the reliability of EPM distances depends on understanding how the dilution is related to physical properties of the SN atmosphere. Recently, new methods have been developed to model light curves and spectra, allowing for a new attempt to improve the determination of H0 using SNe II-P out to a redshift of 0.1. In particular, the Monte-Carlo radiative-transfer code TARDIS (Kerzendorf \u0026amp; Sim 2014) was extended to model spectra of type II-P SNe during their peak and early plateau phases. The new code was used to compute dilution factors (Vogl et al.2019) and it will be used to model the spectra of individual SNe. The final goal is to apply tailored EPM to a set of well observed type II-P SNe in the Hubble flow.\n","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"fc948041e1ef59d1f90bd53734e7e3b7","permalink":"https://afloers.github.io/project/adh0cc/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/adh0cc/","section":"project","summary":"adH0cc is an ESO large programme for the \"accurate determination of H0 with core-collapse supernovae\".","tags":["Supernovae, Radiative Transfer, Cosmology"],"title":"adH0cc","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Find ENGRAVE on the web\nENGRAVE is a international collaboration bringing together astronomers who use the ESO facilities to research gravitational wave events.

During the first peak, the spectrum shows a blue continuum with narrow emission lines of H and Fe II. During the second peak, the spectrum becomes cooler, resembling that of a K-type star, and the emission lines are replaced by a forest of narrow lines in absorption. About 5 months later, while the optical light curves are characterized by a fast linear decline, the NIR ones show a moderate rebrightening, observed until the transient disappears in solar conjunction. At these late epochs, the spectrum becomes reminiscent of that of M-type stars, with prominent molecular absorption bands. The late-time properties suggest the formation of some dust in the expanding common envelope or an IR echo from foreground pre-existing dust.

The rise timescales are longer for SLSNe than for normal SNe Ib/c, by roughly 10 days, for events with similar decay times. Thus, SLSNe-I can be considered as a separate population based on photometric properties. After peak, SLSNe-I decay with a wide range of slopes, with no obvious gap between rapidly declining and slowly declining events. The latter events show more irregularities (bumps) in the light curves at all times. At late times, the SLSN-I light curves slow down and cluster around the 56Co radioactive decay rate.

Using a 56Ni mass prior from near maximum light γ-ray observations, we find 0.053 ± 0.018 M☉ of stable nickel to be present in the ejecta. We find that the iron group features are redshifted from the host galaxy rest frame by ∼600 km s-1.

These are predicted to eject material rich in heavy radioactive isotopes that can power an electromagnetic signal. This signal is luminous at optical and infrared wavelengths and is called a kilonova. The gravitational-wave source GW170817 arose from a binary neutron-star merger in the nearby Universe with a relatively well confined sky position and distance estimate. Here we report observations and physical modelling of a rapidly fading electromagnetic transient in the galaxy NGC 4993, which is spatially coincident with GW170817 and with a weak, short γ-ray burst. The transient has physical parameters that broadly match the theoretical predictions of blue kilonovae from neutron-star mergers. The emitted electromagnetic radiation can be explained with an ejected mass of 0.04 ± 0.01 solar masses, with an opacity of less than 0.5 square centimetres per gram, at a velocity of 0.2 ± 0.1 times light speed. The power source is constrained to have a power-law slope of -1.2 ± 0.3, consistent with radioactive powering from r-process nuclides. (The r-process is a series of neutron capture reactions that synthesise many of the elements heavier than iron.) We identify line features in the spectra that are consistent with light r-process elements (atomic masses of 90-140). As it fades, the transient rapidly becomes red, and a higher-opacity, lanthanide-rich ejecta component may contribute to the emission. This indicates that neutron-star mergers produce gravitational waves and radioactively powered kilonovae, and are a nucleosynthetic source of the r-process elements.

The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of ∼ 1.7s with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg2 at a luminosity distance of 40±8 Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 M_sun. An extensive observing campaign was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT 2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at ∼40 Mpc) less than 11 hours after the merger by the One-Meter, Two Hemisphere (1M2H) team using the 1 m Swope Telescope. The optical transient was independently detected by multiple teams within an hour. Subsequent observations targeted the object and its environment. Early ultraviolet observations revealed a blue transient that faded within 48 hours. Optical and infrared observations showed a redward evolution over ∼10 days. Following early non-detections, X-ray and radio emission were discovered at the transient's position ∼ 9 and ∼ 16 days, respectively, after the merger. Both the X-ray and radio emission likely arise from a physical process that is distinct from the one that generates the UV/optical/near-infrared emission. No ultra-high-energy gamma-rays and no neutrino candidates consistent with the source were found in follow-up searches. These observations support the hypothesis that GW170817 was produced by the merger of two neutron stars in NGC 4993 followed by a short gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) and a kilonova/macronova powered by the radioactive decay of r-process nuclei synthesized in the ejecta.
